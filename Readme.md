This is an experiment repository to port to Julia the code developed in [Canopy Model in R](https://github.com/eap-fes-unigoe/canopy-model)

Only the radiative trasnfer sum-model has been ported so far, but is not up to date with the latest changes.
The perfomrace improvement using Julia has been really promising (almost 1000 faster on quick bechmarks)
